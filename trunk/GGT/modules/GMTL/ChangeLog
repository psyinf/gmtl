---------- --------     -----------------------------------------------------------
2002-05-21 nonchocoboy  Removed Types.h. Apps will now need to define their own
                        types if they wish to use anything other than the
                        built-in primitive types.
2002-05-20 subatomic    Removed gmtlConfig.h.
                        Added support to Math.h to compile out the float trig
                        functions.  Define NO_XXXF (where XXX is SIN, COS, ASIN
                        etc...) to work around compilers that dont support
                        these trig functions.
2002-05-17 subatomic    Doxygen: grouped everything into "modules", logical 
                        groupings that make the reference guide much easier
                        to use.
2002-05-10 nonchocoboy  Added makeInverse for matrices.
2002-05-10 subatomic    Added typedefs for Planef and Planed
2002-05-10 allenb       Added gmtl::ignore_unused_variable_warning to get rid
                        of unused variable warnings for Type2Type<> usage.
2002-05-09 allenb       Configure and make now make link in instlinks instead
                        of copying all the headers over.
2002-05-09 allenb       Added OpenSG conversion functions.

2002-03-20 nonchocoboy  Added overloaded operator<< functions.
2002-03-15 allenb       Added makeRot<mat>(rad,axis) function
                        Added makeTrans<mat>(trans) function.
                        Added makeRot<mat>(val,val,val,method) function.
                        Added setTrans(matrix) function.
2002-03-14 allenb       Added identity(matrix) function.
2002-03-14 allenb       Added gmtlASSERT macro to make gmtl more standalone
2002-02-24 subatomic    Authored Quat and all ops, gens, converts, compares.
2002-02-24 nonchocoboy  Authored LineSeg class and comparitors.
2002-02-20 nonchocoboy  Added Plane math functions.
2002-02-19 subatomic    Authored Matrix gen funcs
2002-02-18 nonchocoboy  Added Plane comparison functions.
