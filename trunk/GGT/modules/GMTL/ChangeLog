DATE       AUTHOR       CHANGE
---------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------
2003-04-18 patrickh     Renamed the vector version of gmtl::cross() that
                        returns a newly created vector to gmtl::makeCross and
                        moved it to Generate.h.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
2003-04-10 subatomic    Matrix state tracking.  Extensive testing on this.
                           Anyone writing their own matrix methods MUST also
                           implement matrix state tracking in every method!!|
                        Added const version of the [][] operator for Matrix
                        Implemented invertAffine, invertOrtho,
                           invertTrans for Matrix
2003-04-01 subatomic    April Fools.
                        added setPerspective, setFrustum
2003-03-31 patrickh     Removed unneeded second argument from the function
                        gmtl::makeInverse<>().  Changed the first argument of
                        same to take a matrix by reference instead of by value.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.2
2003-03-16 subatomic    added operator/=( Quat, Quat )

                        added intersect( Sphere, LineSeg )
                        added intersect( Sphere, Ray )
                        added distanceSquared( LineSeg, Point )
2003-03-15 nonchocoboy  NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
2003-03-15 nonchocoboy  Replaced gmtl::version variable with a
                        gmtl::getVersion() inlined method to avoid mulitply
                        defined linker errors.
2003-03-13 jahare       Fixed quaternion multiplication ordering bug.
2003-03-10 jahare       Added Point *= Matrix, Point *= Quat, and Vec *= Quat

2003-02-24 allenb       Changed Matrix::op[] to allow element access using
                        row, column ordering.  The access element directly
                        use Matrix::mData.
2003-02-21 nonchocoboy  Added gmtl.h convenience header.
2003-02-21 nonchocoboy  gmtl::Math::sign will now take any type as an argument.
2003-02-21 allenb       Fixed bug where direction cosines were being computed
                        incorrectly. The method was actually computing the
                        inverse of the correct value.
2003-02-06 nonchocoboy  Replaced build system with an SCons-based build system.

2002-06-23 subatomic    For safety, don't allow Quat(T,T,T,T) default 
                        constructor.  Added Quat(), and changed Quat(T,T,T,T)
                        which to not use defaults.
2002-06-13 subatomic    For safety, don't allow VecBase(DATA_TYPE) constructor.
                        Also don't allow mismatched constructors such as
                        Vec3( a, b ), or Vec2( a, b, c ), these will assert now.
2002-06-12 subatomic    EulerAngle is templatized on RotationOrder now.
                        This means that EulerXYZ and EulerZYX are discrete types
                        which will allow the benefit of type safety and compile 
                        time optimization.
2002-06-10 subatomic    Generators all use Euler and Axis now.
                        Changed to set() and make() naming on functions
                        that were actually set (like setRot(quat,axisangle)
                        Templatized many of the Generate funcs.  Now you can
                        set(anytype, anyothertype) and make<anytype>(anyother).
                        Coord is now templatized on POS_TYPE, ROT_TYPE.
                        Default Coord typedefs are with Vec/Euler, Vec/Axis now.
                        NEW VERSION 0.0.5

                        NEW VERSION: 0.0.2
2002-06-03 nonchocoboy  Authored Version.h
2002-05-21 nonchocoboy  Removed Types.h. Apps will now need to define their own
                        types if they wish to use anything other than the
                        built-in primitive types.
2002-05-20 subatomic    Removed gmtlConfig.h.
                        Added support to Math.h to compile out the float trig
                        functions.  Define NO_XXXF (where XXX is SIN, COS, ASIN
                        etc...) to work around compilers that dont support
                        these trig functions.
2002-05-17 subatomic    Doxygen: grouped everything into "modules", logical 
                        groupings that make the reference guide much easier
                        to use.

2002-05-09 allenb       Configure and make now make link in instlinks instead
                        of copying all the headers over.
